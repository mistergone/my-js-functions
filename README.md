===============

JavaScript functions I wrote that I might want to reuse some day.

**get_url_key_value_pairs.js** - Returns all key-value pairs from the URL. Easily modified for specific tasks. Uses jQuery's $.each(), but it doesn't really have to.

**title_case.js** - Customizable function to turn a string to title case while leaving select words lowercase.
